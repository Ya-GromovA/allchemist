## Baseline visual mismatch

- Sidebar had the right deep-blue direction but missed the approved full navigation density, logo lockup, license card, message badge, and collapse control.
- Topbar did not match the approved greeting/search/actions/profile structure.
- Hero row did not match the approved three-zone composition: continue learning, live lesson, and AI recommendations.
- Quick access strip was missing.
- Teacher tasks, weak topics, popular content, weekly progress, locked license card, and floating assistant were missing or represented by simplified substitutes.
- Desktop spacing was too sparse and card density was lower than the approved reference.
- Mobile had been fixed in visual QA, but still did not follow the approved mobile first-viewport composition.
